Dominic has been playing chess from a young age but never joined a club or took any "serious" learning until much later in life, briefly joining Sydenham Chess Club in 2007 before moving from the area. He has played online, more so during lockdown, and joined the club in 2021. He is thoroughly enjoying his first proper season of OTB chess hopes to compete and improve with the club. Dominic currently helps maintain the club website.
