I was pleased with this game. Until putting it through the engine, my favourite moment turned out to be a "blunder" according to Stockfish! I had planned to exploit white's undefended dark squared diagonal and pushed with 15. .. e4??. Looks good and wins the rook. However, kicking out the Knight on c5 is far better with 15... b6. It removes a defender of e5 first as well as removing the threat of Nxb7.

Great opportunity to learn to always look for something better when you get excited :)
