Today's lesson, don't rush when you've time. We both had time on the clock going into the end game and I started to speed up - some kind of fatherly concern over my 9 year old opponent's bed time?! I thought Ramsey played a really sharp and tight game here, but I should have at least had the draw he offered around move 31.
