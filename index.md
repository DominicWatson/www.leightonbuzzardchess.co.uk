## Over-the-board chess

The Bedfordshire Leagues are once again running and we have returned to OTB chess for the 2021/22 season. To view our current season fixtures, results, players and games, browse our [Teams pages](/teams/).

We are not currently running any club nights other than scheduled matches. We would love to start club nights/ tournaments again if we can get the numbers. If you're interested do let us know!
